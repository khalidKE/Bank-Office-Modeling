### **Phases of the Tutorial**
#### **Phase 1: Creating a Simple Model**  
- build a foundational bank service system.  
- Collect and analyze basic statistics for validation.

---

#### **Phase 2: Creating Model Animation**  
-  add animations for better visualization of the system flow.
- Key Steps:
Design visual elements for queues.
Add animations for ATMs.
Adjust layout and markers for customer paths.

---

#### **Phase 3: Adding Tellers**  
- add tellers to the system to handle specific customer requests. This involves using resources to model teller behavior.

### Modifying the Flowchart
1. **Create a Service Block**:
   - Drag the **Service** block from the **Process Modeling Library** to the **Main** diagram.
   - Set `Queue capacity` to **20**.
   - Set `Delay time` to `triangular(2.5, 6, 11)`.

2. **Adjust the Process Flowchart**:
   - Add a **SelectOutput** block to divide customer flow between ATMs and tellers.
   - Set the condition in the **SelectOutput** block to `randomTrue(0.5)` for equal distribution.

3. **Add a ResourcePool for Tellers**:
   - Drag a **ResourcePool** block to the diagram and name it **tellers**.
   - Set its `Capacity` to **4**.
   - Connect the **Service** block to the **ResourcePool** using `Seize` and `Release`.

---

### Adding Space Markup Shapes
1. **Queue Area**:
   - Draw a **Rectangular Node** for the waiting area and name it **waitingArea**.
   - Link it to the queue in the **Service** block properties.

2. **Customer and Teller Areas**:
   - Create **Rectangular Nodes** for customer and teller positions, naming them **customerPlaces** and **tellerPlaces**.
   - Add **attractors** for customer positions and teller spots.
   - Align all nodes and attractors to ensure proper placement.

---

### Adding 3D Objects
1. **Teller 3D Objects**:
   - Create a **Resource Type** named **Teller** with an **Office Worker** figure.
   - Configure the **ResourcePool** to use this type.

2. **Teller Tables**:
   - Drag **Table** objects from the **3D Objects Palette** to align with teller attractors.
   - Adjust the rotation and position for proper alignment.

---

#### **Phase 4: Creating a Simple Model**  
- collect utilization and time-related statistics using charts and blocks.

### Collecting Utilization Statistics
1. **Bar Chart for ATM Utilization**:
   - Drag a **Bar Chart** to the diagram.
   - Add a data item titled **ATM utilization** with the value `ATM.statsUtilization.mean()`.

2. **Bar Chart for Queue Length**:
   - Add another **Bar Chart** for **Queue length**.
   - Set the value to `queue.statsSize.mean()`.

---

### Collecting Customer Time Statistics
1. **Measure Customer Time in System**:
   - Place a **TimeMeasureStart** block at the entry point of the flowchart.
   - Place a **TimeMeasureEnd** block near the sink and name it **timeTotal**.
   - Link the **TimeMeasureStart** block to the **TimeMeasureEnd** block.

2. **Histogram for Time Distribution**:
   - Drag a **Histogram** to the diagram.
   - Add a data item titled **Time in system distribution** with the value `timeTotal.distribution`.
